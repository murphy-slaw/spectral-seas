# Towns and Towers Structure Tiles

This adds structure tiles for the Towns and Towers mod/datapack, version 1.12.1:

* https://modrinth.com/mod/towns-and-towers

Currently it adds tiles for most land village types and the "Desert temple mimic" structure. Very small "villages" like the grove outpost and the snowy slopes inn don't have any streets, so they only get markers.

Markers for T&T structures are in the 'towns_and_towers' directory, matching the layout of the data pack.

TODO:
 * Add ships (ocean villages and outposts)
 * Customize tiles
