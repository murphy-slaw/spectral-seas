        "All Ships, of any Design, require the same Elements, albeit in differing Measure. A Hull is wrought from Timber like a Boat, but grander in Scale. Sails need stout Masts, woolen Sheets to catch the Wind, and fortified Ropes for Rigging. Further Ropes secure the Vessel's Fittings and Cargo.$(p)Of Timber, I have already spoken. Gather a great Heap of it, for Needs may exceed Estimation.  Wood Type matters not, and may be chosen by Taste or Opportunity. For Masts, the stripped Bole of a Tree serves best.$(p)Sailcloth needs a tidy Stockpile of Wool â€“ and I trust you have saved enough Sheeps to fill the Order.$(p)Rigging demands its own Topic.$(p)",
