        "Having survived the first Night, the Time has come to assess the Island's true Bounty.$(p)Islands appear in many Forms – from sprawling Landmasses with towering Crags to tiny Islets scarcely larger than a Sandbar. Their Climates range from lush Rain-Forests to brutal Deserts or cold-bitten Coasts. $(p)Each provides or withholds the Stuff of Life according to its Nature.",
        "The Gifts of an Island are threefold - its Timber, its Minerals, and its allotment of Animals - and each of these may be bountiful or meagre.$(p)Of these, animal Life depletes most easily, for their Numbers are small and replenish slowly. Fish suffice for Food, but yield neither Wool nor Leather. Establishing a Ranch may tempt, but whoever took to the Sea hoping to be a Farmer?$(p)A Survivor needs Timber, for Fuel, Tools – and Ships. Few Islands are bereft of Wood, but faced with a Lack one may scour the nearby Waters for Wrecks or Drift-Wood.$(p)",
        "Mineral Wealth is most uncertain. It would be a blighted Island that had no reserves of Coal and Copper, nor any Stone for Tools – but other Treasure may be lacking.$(p)Surface Iron is rare except in Mountains, which may be absent. Below the Surface, Weath abounds, but Openings to those Caves sulk among the Cliffs and Crags.$(p)With Luck, a Survivor otherwise impoverished might gain Metals from Wrecks or Ruins.",
        "With all such Allotments in the Hands of capricious Fortune, only the luckiest of Castaways could hope to find themselves ashore in a Paradise of Abundance.$(p)A canny Survivor will exploit such Gifts as present themselves – while always keeping an Eye on the Horizon for further Lands that beckon.$(p)Even if amply supplied, once Survival is assured the wise Sailor works towards the Sea – and Escape."
