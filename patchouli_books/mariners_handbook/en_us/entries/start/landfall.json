        "If you are reading this Handbook, you are either shipwrecked, or will become so some Day. In such Circumstances, preserving one's Life is paramount.$(p)First Priority is a hasty Survey of the Island upon whose Shore the Sea has disgorged you, seeking improvised Shelter and such Sustenance as the Land may offer.$(p)Rations are the next Order of Business, for an empty Belly kills more surely than any Predator, and Hunger grows apace, whether one labors vigorously or stands idle.$(p)",
        "Some Islands may offer Fruits or other Vegetable Matter to feed the Castaway, but Chance may provide only Meat or Fish as Food. $(p)A crude Spear of Wood or tipped with Stone should suffice to bring down small Game.$(p)In the Waters, a desperate Sailor may seize Fish by Hand, but even the meanest of Tools will give better Result.$(p)A fortunate Castaway may gain Wool for Bedding by hunting Sheeps, but be wary of slaughtering all, for Wool shall be needed for Sails to secure your Escape.$(p)",
        "Hunger may provoke one to feed greedily upon the first raw Flesh obtained, but let Reason prevail - cook all Foods for superior Sustenance and Preservation.$(p) If the Island be too miserly to provide Stone for a Cooking-Furnace, a Campfire will suffice.$(p)Once one's Belly and Ration-Bag have been provided for, seek a Shelter for the night. The meanest of Accommodations will suffice - a small Chamber dug into a hillside, a crude Hut of Wood, or even the limbs of a Tree.$(p)Light the area well with Campfires or Torches to keep Creatures at bay, and if Sleep will not come, do such Work as one can until Morning.$(p)",
