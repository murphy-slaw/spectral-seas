# Abridged Resource Pack

A simple resource pack to display Abridged bridges in the Atlas.

Abridged uses jigsaws under the hood, but it places them with a custom structure type (abridged:bridge) so AA can't identify which jigsaw is in which chunk. So this uses a simple single tileset that tiles both vertically and horizontally.

I am not much of an artist, so the tiles are based on the Nether Bridge Crossing tiles, with the lava removed.
