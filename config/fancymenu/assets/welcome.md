# The Situation

You met your Grandad but once, but his colorful garb, theatrical mannerisms, and wild tales of life on the open sea left a permanent impression. Father always spoke disdainfully of the old man, but this did nothing to dim your fascination. When he passed on, he left you a modest inheritance and an exceedingly dull family business. It was no surprise when you sold off the enterprise and joined a merchant crew as a deckhand.
In retrospect, it should also have been no surprise when the ship was set upon by pirates and you were hurled overboard in shark-infested waters.
You very nearly drowned, and now you've washed ashore upon an unknown island, with nothing but a bundle of rations, your Grandad's nasty old cutlass, and a tattered book that a sailor thrust in your hand shortly after the ship disembarked.
It will be dark sooner than you know, and you're getting hungry. Hopefullly some trace of Grandad's swashbuckling blood will keep you alive long enough to get out of here.

## Meanwhile, in the real world

Welcome to the first public beta release of Spectral Seas! This release focuses on refining the loot system, tuning structure placement, and some fairly major surgery to the enchanting system. Here are some things to be aware of:

- The enchanting table has been removed! Collect enchanted items from structures and ruins and combine them with an anvil. Later in the progression, other options for enchanting open up.
- Diamonds are rarer in loot. Most diamond equipment in loot is "broken" and requires diamonds to repair.
- Named or enchanted items don't vanish at zero durability, they become broken and unusable until repaired at an anvil.
- Most types of equipment can be upgraded between material tiers. Unenchanted items can be upgraded at the crafting table, enchanted items need an anvil.
- Ship upgrades are primarily found in Pirate (pillager) structures. Face off against these ruffians to make your ship faster or hold more cargo.
- Structures contain themed loot. The resources and enchantments available vary significantly between locations.
