## The Situation

You met your Grandad but once, but his colorful garb, theatrical mannerisms, and wild tales of life on the open sea left a permanent impression. Father always spoke disdainfully of the old man, but this did nothing to dim your fascination. When he passed on, he left you a modest inheritance and an exceedingly dull family business. It was no surprise when you sold off the enterprise and joined a merchant crew as a deckhand.
In retrospect, it should also have been no surprise when the ship was set upon by pirates and you were hurled overboard in shark-infested waters.
You very nearly drowned, and now you've washed ashore upon an unknown island, with nothing but a bundle of rations, your Grandad's nasty old cutlass, and a tattered book that a sailor thrust in your hand shortly after the ship disembarked.
It will be dark sooner than you know, and you're getting hungry. Hopefullly some trace of Grandad's swashbuckling blood will keep you alive long enough to get out of here.

## Meanwhile, in the real world

Welcome to the first test release of Spectral Seas. The primary purpose of this test is to give the custom mechanics a thorough shakedown. While most of the content should be completable, there is still a lot of work to be done on tuning the experience for fun.
